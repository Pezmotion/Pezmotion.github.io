My name is John Siddoway. I have been a professional software engineer for about 10 years now.  I live in the Seattle, WA, area with my wife, our two kids, and our menagerie of pets.

In my scant free time, you can find me playing video games, tabletop games, or attempting to keep my classical guitar skills up to snuff.
