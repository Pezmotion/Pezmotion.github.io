### Overview

I touched on it briefly in a previous post. I no longer remember *why* I started looking into this, but eventually I found [this article](http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/magnifying-glass-for-images-using-jquery-and-css3) with a pretty good example showing how to create a 'magnifying lens' effect on images. I didn't like the fact that it used two different images for the "thumbnail" and the "magnifying lens." Thanks to Bootstrap (and other CSS frameworks), you can load the original image on the page and use CSS on the thunbnail image to shrink it down.

### Working Example

<img class="img-fluid magnify-this" src="{{ '/assets/img/2019-02-14-battletech.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Battletech Screenshot">
